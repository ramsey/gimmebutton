Gimme Button for Firefox
========================

This package provides a Gimme Bar toolbar button for Firefox.

The source contains build scripts (build.sh and build_mac.sh) to generate the XPI zipped file used for installation in Firefox. To generate the XPI file to install, simply run the build script for the appropriate environment:

* On Linux: `./build.sh`
* On Mac: `./build_mac.sh`

Once built, the gimmebar.xpi file may be distributed and installed in Firefox in any environment. It does not need to be built for a specific target environment.
